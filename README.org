#+TITLE:     Proton Pass CLI Beta in Guix
#+AUTHOR:    Jack R. Williams

I have not gotten this to work with kernel keyring in guix, but can confirm both env and fs keyrings work set via ~PROTON_PASS_KEY_PROVIDER~ env var following the [[https://protonpass.github.io/pass-cli/get-started/configuration/][documentation]].

Useful for containers but *not* secure.

** Installation
Working on adding package channel but currently depends on nonguix binary-build-system.

Can be installed via
#+begin_src bash
  guix install -L /path/to/git/repository protonpass-cli
#+end_src

** Usage
To login use:
#+begin_src bash
  pass-cli login
#+end_src
If ~PROTON_PASS_KEY_PROVIDER~ is not set and it cannot access keyring you will get:
#+begin_src sh
    Error: Error creating client features

    Caused by:
      0: Failed to get encryption key for database
      1: Could not get local key from keyring
      2: Error accessing keyring: No matching entry found in secure storage
#+end_src
